# Criptoreal Masternode
To run this script you need:

1. The IP of your VPS
2. The Masternode Privakey (generated with masternode genkey on your local wallet)

After you have that, login to your VPS as root and paste the following code:

```
sudo wget https://github.com/CriptoRealDev/Criptoreal-Masternode/blob/v1.0/install-masternode.sh && chmod +x install-masternode.sh && ./install-masternode.sh
```

*Let it run and that's it!*
